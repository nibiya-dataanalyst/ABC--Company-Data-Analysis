# ABC--Company-Data-Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of ABC Company’s workforce, utilizing a dataset of 458 employees to uncover organizational trends and financial distributions. The workflow began with a rigorous preprocessing phase where the "height" column was corrected using randomized values ($150-180$) to ensure data consistency. Adhering to professional integrity standards, a Data Cleaning Log was maintained to document these adjustments, and records were flagged for full traceability. The analysis explores employee distribution across teams, position segregation, and age demographics, while specifically identifying the highest salary expenditures by team and role. By visualizing the correlation between age and salary through Seaborn and Matplotlib, the project transforms raw data into a structured "Data Story" that highlights key patterns in the company’s human capital and financial allocations.
